In this project, an agent-based social simulation of 15-30 year olds in different environments is designed and implemented using Soil, a Simulator in Python focused on Social Networks. This allows to test different policies and their effectiveness in different areas of a city, which could improve decision-making from the council of the cities where this simulation is tested.
